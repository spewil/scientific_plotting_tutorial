    # Part 2: Different types of colormap in matplotlib
    # From part 1, we saw an example of a continous, sequential colormap, we now consider other types of
    # colormap you may find useful
    # You can find all the info here: https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html

    # For showing value ranges where negative and positive values have distinct meanings - for example
    # negative means that a neuron is suppressed, whereas positive means that a neuron is enhanced, it is useful
    # to use a divergent colormap to illustrate that there are two 'axis' being plotted:
    # (1) degree of enhacement and (2) degree of suppression

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    num_data_points = 30

    heatmap = ax.imshow(all_neuron_mean_response_matrix, cmap='seismic')
    cbar = fig.colorbar(heatmap)


    # For showing categorical variables, we use a categorical colormap, here, the objective is to maximise how much
    # different categories can be distinguished, and therefore it is better to use something that maximises contrast
    # (rather than a perceptually uniform colormap)

    # This demo serves a secondary purpose, sometimes there are objects that you want to color that does not have
    # the cmap parameter, in that case, will need to obtain the list of colors  and manually apply them to the objects
    # that we want
